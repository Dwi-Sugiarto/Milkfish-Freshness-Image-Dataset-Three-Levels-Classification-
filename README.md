# Milkfish-Freshness-Image-Dataset-Three-Levels-Classification-
This dataset contains a collection of milkfish images categorized into three levels of freshness: Fresh, Less Fresh, and Rotten. The images were captured using a Canon 100D digital camera, with guidance from local aquaculture farmers and fish vendors, who acted as domain experts to ensure accurate labeling. This dataset is designed to support the development of deep learning-based image classification models for the automatic detection of fish freshness. It is suitable for research in computer vision, image classification, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and digital image processing in the fisheries domain.
